This page provides links to selected R packages I have (co)authored. The most recent versions of most packages are [on github](https://github.com/robjhyndman/). Most packages are also [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com). A few packages are omitted because they are out-dated or because my involvement was minimal.

The methods are described in [Dokumentov & Hyndman (2014) Bivariate data with ridges: two-dimensional smoothing of mortality rates](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/mortality-smoothing/).
