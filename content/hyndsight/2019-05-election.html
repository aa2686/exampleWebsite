<p>I’ve tried my hand at writing for the wider public with an <a href="https://theconversation.com/you-are-what-you-vote-the-social-and-demographic-factors-that-influence-your-vote-116591"><strong>article for The Conversation</strong></a> based on my paper with Di Cook and Jeremy Forbes on <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/publications/elections/">“Spatial modelling of the two-party preferred vote in Australian federal elections: 2001-2016”</a>. With the next Australian election taking place tomorrow, we thought it was timely to put out a publicly accessible version of our analysis.</p>
