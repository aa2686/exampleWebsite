<p>From today’s email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have just finished reading a copy of <a href="http://www.otexts.org/fpp">‘Forecasting:Principles and Practice’</a> and I have found the book really interesting. I have particularly enjoyed the case studies and focus on practical applications.</p>
<p>After finishing the book I have joined a forecasting competition to put what I’ve learnt to the test. I do have a couple of queries about the forecasting outputs required. The output required is a quantile forecast, is this the same as prediction intervals? Is there any R function to produce quantiles from 0 to 99?</p>
<p>If you were able to point me in the right direction regarding the above it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Many Thanks,</p>

<p>Presumably the competition is <a href="http://www.gefcom.org">GEFCOM2014</a> which I’ve <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/gefcom-2014/">posted about before</a>.</p>
<p>The future value of a time series is unknown, so you can think of it as a random variable, and its distribution is the “forecast distribution”. A “quantile forecast” is a quantile of the forecast distribution. The usual point forecast is often the mean or the median of the forecast distribution. A prediction interval is a range of specified coverage probability under that distribution. For example, if we assume the forecast distribution is normal, then the 95% prediction interval is defined by the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the forecast distribution.</p>
<p>Still assuming normality, we could generate the forecast quantiles from 1% to 99% in R using</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    qnorm((1:99)/100, m, s)</code></pre>
<p>where <code>mu</code> and <code>sigma</code> are the estimated mean and standard deviation of the forecast distribution. So if you are using the forecast package in R, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    library(forecast)
    fit &lt;- auto.arima(WWWusage)
    fc &lt;- forecast(fit, h=20, level=95)
    qf &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=99, ncol=20)
    m &lt;- fc$mean
    s &lt;- (fc$upper-fc$lower)/1.96/2
    for(h in 1:20)
      qf[,h] &lt;- qnorm((1:99)/100, m[h], s[h])

    plot(fc)
    matlines(101:120, t(qf), col=rainbow(120), lty=1)</code></pre>

<p>Of course, assuming a normal distribution is rather restrictive and not very interesting. For a more interesting but much more complicated approach to generating quantiles, see my 2010 paper on <a href="/publications/peak-electricity-demand/">Density forecasting for long-term peak electricity demand</a>.</p>
