<p>I’ve pushed a minor update to the forecast package to CRAN. Some highlights are listed here.</p>

<div id="plotting-time-series-with-ggplot2" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting time series with ggplot2</h2>
<p>You can now facet a time series plot like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
lungDeaths &lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths)
autoplot(lungDeaths, facets=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/hyndsight/2016-09-09-forecast-v7-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So <code>autoplot.mts</code> now behaves similarly to <code>plot.mts</code></p>
</div>
<div id="multi-step-fitted-values" class="section level2">
<h2>Multi-step fitted values</h2>
<p>The <code>fitted</code> function has a new argument <code>h</code> to allow computation of in-sample fitted values of more than one-step-ahead. In time series, fitted values are defined as the one-step-forecasts of the data used in training a model. Sometimes it is useful to have corresponding <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>-step forecasts, where <span class="math inline">\(h&gt;1\)</span>. This is now possible.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit &lt;- Arima(WWWusage,c(3,1,0))
tab &lt;- cbind(data=WWWusage,
  &#39;h=1&#39; = fitted(fit, h=1),
  &#39;h=2&#39; = fitted(fit, h=2),
  &#39;h=3&#39; = fitted(fit, h=3))
autoplot(tab) + ylab(&quot;Internet users&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Minute&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="theta-method-now-with-seasonal-adjustment" class="section level2">
<h2>Theta method now with seasonal adjustment</h2>
<p>The Theta method was proposed by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-2070(00)00066-2">Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos (2000)</a>, and has been repeatedly shown to produce remarkably good forecasts. I included a non-seasonal form of the method (via <code>thetaf</code>) in the forecast package a long time ago, but I’ve now updated it to allow for seasonal time series as well. It is not quite identical to the A&amp;N method, due to differences in optimization criteria, but it is close.</p>
</div>
<div id="tiny-time-series" class="section level2">
<h2>Tiny time series</h2>
<p>With the forecast package being increasingly used for large scale automatic forecasting, it is important that it does not fail on edge cases such as time series consisting of 2 or 3 observations. I’ve made some new tweaks to allow <code>ets()</code> and <code>auto.arima()</code> to produce sensible results in these cases. I wouldn’t bet my house on forecasts using only 2 observations, but they aren’t too bad.</p>
</div>
<div id="seasonal-adjustment-extensions" class="section level2">
<h2>Seasonal adjustment extensions</h2>
<p>The package has long offered seasonal adjustment via the <code>seasadj</code> function, applied to objects created using <code>stl</code>, <code>decompose</code>, and <code>tbats</code>. This has now been generalized to an S3 function so other people can write S3 seasonal adjustment methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="standardized-first-arguments" class="section level2">
<h2>Standardized first arguments</h2>
<p>The various modelling functions have either used <code>x</code> as the first argument or <code>y</code> as the first argument, to refer to the univariate time series to be modelled. To be consistent, this is now <code>y</code> in all functions. However, <code>x</code> will still work to avoid backwards compatibility issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="bug-fixes-and-speed-improvements" class="section level2">
<h2>Bug fixes and speed improvements</h2>
<p>As usual, there have been lots of bug fixes, mostly in functionality introduced in v7. More details are provided in the <a href="http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/news/">Changelog</a> or in the <a href="https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast/commits/master">github commits</a>.</p>
