<p>Almost all prediction intervals from time series models are too narrow. This is a well-known phenomenon and arises because they do not account for all sources of uncertainty. In my <a href="/publications/hksg/">2002 IJF paper</a>, we measured the size of the problem by computing the actual coverage percentage of the prediction intervals on hold-out samples. We found that for ETS models, nominal 95% intervals may only provide coverage between 71% and 87%. The difference is due to missing sources of uncertainty.</p>
<p>There are at least four sources of uncertainty in forecasting using time series models:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The random error term;</li>
<li>The parameter estimates;</li>
<li>The choice of model for the historical data;</li>
<li>The continuation of the historical data generating process into the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>When we produce prediction intervals for time series models, we generally only take into account the first of these sources of uncertainty. It would be possible to account for 2 and 3 using simulations, but that is almost never done because it would take too much time to compute. As computing speeds increase, it might become a viable approach in the future.</p>
<p>Even if we ignore the model uncertainty and the DGP uncertainty (sources 3 and 4), and just try to allow for parameter uncertainty as well as the random error term (sources 1 and 2), there are no closed form solutions apart from some simple special cases.</p>
<p>One such special case is an ARIMA(0,1,0) model with drift, which can be written as
<span class="math display">\[
y_t = y_{t-1} + c + e_t,
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(e_t\)</span> is a white noise process. In this case, it is easy to compute the uncertainty associated with the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and then allow for it in the forecasts.</p>
<p>This model can be fitted using either the <code>Arima</code> function or the <code>rwf</code> function from the forecast package for R. If the <code>Arima</code> function is used, the uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is ignored, but if the <code>rwf</code> function is used, the uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is included in the prediction intervals. The difference can be seen in the following simulated example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(forecast)

set.seed(22)
x &lt;-ts(cumsum(rnorm(50, -2.5, 4)))

RWD.x &lt;- rwf(x,  h=40, drift=TRUE, level=95)
ARIMA.x &lt;- Arima(x, c(0,1,0), include.drift=TRUE)

plot(forecast(ARIMA.x, h=40, level=95))
lines(RWD.x$lower, lty=2)
lines(RWD.x$upper, lty=2)</code></pre>
