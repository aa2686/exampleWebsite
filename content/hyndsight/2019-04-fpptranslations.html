<p>There are now translations of my forecasting textbook (coauthored with George Athanasopoulos) into Chinese and Korean.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://otexts.com/fppcn/"><strong>Chinese translation</strong></a> was produced by a team led by <a href="https://yanfei.site/">Professor Yanfei Kang</a> (Beihang University) and <a href="https://feng.li/">Professor Feng Li</a> (Central University of Finance and Economics). The following students were also involved: Cheng Fan, Liu Yu, Long Xiaoyu, Wang Xiaoqian, Zeng Jiayue, Zhang Bohan, and Zhu Shuaidong.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://otexts.com/fppkr/"><strong>Korean translation</strong></a> was produced by <a href="http://danielykim.me/">Dr Daniel Young Ho Kim</a>.</p>
<p>I am very thankful to the hard work and language skills of these people, making the book more accessible to many more people.</p>
<p>If anyone else is interested in creating an online translation of the book into their own language, please let me know.</p>
