<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast7-ggplot2/">my previous post on the forecast package v7</a>, the most visible feature was the introduction of <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2 graphics</a>. This post briefly summarizes the remaining new features of forecast v7.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<div id="tslm-rewritten" class="section level3">
<h3>tslm rewritten</h3>
<p>The <code>tslm</code> function is designed to fit linear models to time series data. It is intended to approximately mimic <code>lm</code> (and calls <code>lm</code> to do the estimation), but to package the output to remember the <code>ts</code> attributes. It also handles some predictor variables automatically, notably <code>trend</code> and <code>season</code>. The re-write means that <code>tslm</code> now handles functions as predictors, including <code>fourier</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>deaths.lm  &lt;- tslm(mdeaths ~ trend + fourier(mdeaths,3))
mdeaths.fcast &lt;- forecast(deaths.lm,
    data.frame(fourier(mdeaths,3,36)))
autoplot(mdeaths.fcast)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/hyndsight/2016-06-01-forecast7-part-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that <code>fourier</code> now takes 3 arguments. The first is the series, which is only used to grab the seasonal period and the <code>tsp</code> attribute. The second argument <code>K</code> is the number of Fourier harmonics to compute. If the third argument <code>h</code> is <code>NULL</code> (the default), the function returns Fourier terms for the times of the historical observations. But if <code>h</code> is a positive integer, the function returns Fourier terms for the next <code>h</code> time periods after the end of the historical data.</p>
<p>The <code>lm</code> function has long allowed a matrix to be passed and independent linear models fitted to each column. The new <code>tslm</code> function also allows this now.</p>
</div>
<div id="bias-adjustment-for-box-cox-transformations" class="section level3">
<h3>Bias adjustment for Box-Cox transformations</h3>
<p>Almost all modelling and forecasting functions in the package allow Box-Cox transformations to be applied before the model is fitted, and for the forecasts to be back transformed. This will give median forecasts on the original scale, as <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/backtransforming/">I’ve explained before</a>.</p>
<p>There is now an option to adjust the forecasts so they are means rather than medians, but setting <code>biasadj=TRUE</code> whenever the forecasts are computed. I will probably make this the default in some future version, but for now the default is <code>biasadj=FALSE</code> so the forecasts are actually medians.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(fpp, quietly=TRUE)
fit &lt;- ets(eggs, model=&quot;AAN&quot;, lambda=0)
fc1 &lt;- forecast(fit, biasadj=TRUE, h=20, level=95)
fc2 &lt;- forecast(fit, biasadj=FALSE, h=20)
cols &lt;- c(&quot;Mean&quot;=&quot;#0000ee&quot;,&quot;Median&quot;=&quot;#ee0000&quot;)
autoplot(fc1) + ylab(&quot;Price&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) +
  autolayer(fc2, PI=FALSE, series=&quot;Median&quot;) +
  autolayer(fc1, PI=FALSE, series=&quot;Mean&quot;) +
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(name=&quot;Forecasts&quot;,values=cols)</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="a-new-ccf-function" class="section level3">
<h3>A new Ccf function</h3>
<p>Cross-correlations can now be computed using <code>Ccf</code>, mimicing <code>ccf</code> except that the axes are more informative.</p>
<p>The <code>Acf</code> function now handles multivariate time series, with cross-correlation functions computed as well as the ACFs of each series.</p>
</div>
<div id="covariates-in-neural-net-ar-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Covariates in neural net AR models</h3>
<p>The <code>nnetar</code> function allows neural networks to be applied to time series data by building a nonlinear autoregressive model. A new feature allows additional inputs to be included in the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="better-subsetting-of-time-series" class="section level3">
<h3>Better subsetting of time series</h3>
<p><code>subset.ts</code> allows quite sophisticated subsetting of a time series. For example</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(subset(gas,month=&quot;November&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/hyndsight/2016-06-01-forecast7-part-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>subset(woolyrnq,quarter=3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Time Series:
## Start = 1965.5 
## End = 1994.5 
## Frequency = 1 
##  [1] 6633 6730 6946 6915 7190 7105 6840 7819 7045 5540 5906 5505 5318 5466 5696
## [16] 5341 5464 5129 5524 6080 6540 6339 6590 6077 5146 5127 5222 4954 5309 6396</code></pre>
<p>This is now substantially more robust than it used to be.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-next" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>The next major release will probably be around the end of 2016. On the to-do list are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In-sample multi-step fitted values</strong>. Currently <code>fitted</code> returns in-sample one-step forecasts. A new argument to <code>fitted</code> will allow multi-step forecasts of the training data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applying fitted models to new data sets</strong>. A related issue is to take an estimated model and apply it to some new data without re-estimating parameters. This is already possible with <code>Arima</code> and <code>ets</code> models. It will be extended to many more model types.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better choice of seasonal differencing</strong>. Currently <code>auto.arima</code> does a pretty good job at finding the orders of a model, and the number of first-differences required, but it does not handle seasonal differences well. It often selects 0 differences, when I think it should select 1 difference. So I tend to over-ride the automatic choice with <code>auto.arima(x, D=1)</code>. I will attempt to find some better tests of seasonal unit roots than those that are currently implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction intervals for NNAR forecasts</strong>. The forecasts obtained using a NNAR model (via the <code>nnetar</code> function) do not have prediction intervals because there is no underlying stochastic model on which to base them. However, there are ways of computing the uncertainty using simulation, and I hope to implement something like that for the next version.</p></li>
</ul>
