<p>Sometimes it is useful to “backcast” a time series — that is, forecast in reverse time. Although there are no in-built R functions to do this, it is very easy to implement. Suppose <code>x</code> is our time series and we want to backcast for <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> periods. Here is some code that should work for most univariate time series. The example is non-seasonal, but the code will also work with seasonal data.<!-- more --></p>
<pre class="r"><code>    library(forecast)
    x &lt;- WWWusage
    h &lt;- 20
    f &lt;- frequency(x)
    # Reverse time
    revx &lt;- ts(rev(x), frequency=f)
    # Forecast
    fc &lt;- forecast(auto.arima(revx), h)
    plot(fc)</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>    # Reverse time again
    fc$mean &lt;- ts(rev(fc$mean),end=tsp(x)[1] - 1/f, frequency=f)
    fc$upper &lt;- fc$upper[h:1,]
    fc$lower &lt;- fc$lower[h:1,]
    fc$x &lt;- x
    # Plot result
    plot(fc, xlim=c(tsp(x)[1]-h/f, tsp(x)[2]))</code></pre>
