<p>Many users have tried to do a seasonal decomposition with a short time series, and hit the error “Series has less than two periods”.</p>
<p>The problem is that the usual methods of decomposition (e.g., <code>decompose</code> and <code>stl</code>) estimate seasonality using at least as many degrees of freedom as there are seasonal periods. So you need at least two observations per seasonal period to be able to distinguish seasonality from noise.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to use a linear regression model to decompose a time series into trend and seasonal components, and then some smoothness assumptions on the seasonal component allow a decomposition with fewer than two full years of data.</p>
<p>This problem <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/51329598/144157">came up on crossvalidated.com</a> recently, with the following data set.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- ts(c(2735.869,2857.105,2725.971,2734.809,2761.314,2828.224,2830.284,
  2758.149,2774.943,2782.801,2861.970,2878.688,3049.229,3029.340,3099.041,
  3071.151,3075.576,3146.372,3005.671,3149.381), start=c(2016,8), frequency=12)</code></pre>
<p>We can approximate the seasonal pattern using <a href="https://otexts.org/fpp2/useful-predictors.html#fourier-series">Fourier terms</a> with a few parameters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
decompose_df &lt;- tslm(df ~ trend + fourier(df, 2))</code></pre>
<p>Then the usual decomposition plot can be constructed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trend &lt;- coef(decompose_df)[1] + coef(decompose_df)[&#39;trend&#39;]*seq_along(df)
components &lt;- cbind(
  data = df,
  trend = trend,
  season = df - trend - residuals(decompose_df),
  remainder = residuals(decompose_df)
)
autoplot(components, facet=TRUE)</code></pre>

<p>Here the model is
<span class="math display">\[
  y_t = \alpha + \beta t + \sum_{k=1}^K \left[
    \gamma_k \sin\left(\textstyle\frac{2\pi t k}{m}\right) +
    \psi_k \cos\left(\textstyle\frac{2\pi t k}{m}\right)
    \right] + \varepsilon_t,
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(1 \le K \le m/2\)</span>. The larger the value of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, the more complicated the seasonal pattern that can be estimated. If <span class="math inline">\(K=m/2\)</span>, then we are using <span class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> degrees of freedom for the seasonal component. (The last sin term will be dropped as <span class="math inline">\(\sin(\pi t)=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.) For a short time series, we can use a small value for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, which can be selected by minimizing the AICc or leave-one-out CV statistic (both computed using <code>CV()</code>). In the above example, the AICc is minimized with <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> and CV is minimized with <span class="math inline">\(K=2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The trend could also be made nonlinear, by replacing <code>trend</code> with a polynomial or spline (although both will use up more degrees of freedom, and may not be justified with short time series).</p>
<p>As with other methods of decomposition, it is easy enough to remove the seasonal component to get the seasonally adjusted data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>adjust_df &lt;- df - components[,&#39;season&#39;]
autoplot(df, series=&quot;Data&quot;) +
  autolayer(adjust_df, series=&quot;Seasonally adjusted&quot;)</code></pre>
