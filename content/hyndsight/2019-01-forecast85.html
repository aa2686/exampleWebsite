<p>The latest minor release of the forecast package has now been approved on CRAN and should be available in the next day or so.</p>
<p>Version 8.5 contains the following new features</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated <code>tsCV()</code> to handle exogenous regressors.</li>
<li>Reimplemented <code>naive()</code>, <code>snaive()</code>, <code>rwf()</code> for substantial speed improvements.</li>
<li>Added support for passing arguments to <code>auto.arima()</code> unit root tests.</li>
<li>Improved <code>auto.arima()</code> stepwise search algorithm (some neighbouring models were missed previously).</li>
</ul>
<p>We havenâ€™t done a major release for two years, and there is unlikely to be another one now. Instead, we are working hard on <a href="https://github.com/tidyverts/fable">fable</a>, a tidyverse replacement for the forecast package.</p>
<p>The forecast package will continue to be maintained, but no new features will be added.</p>
